    <H1>Alex Vlasie's Resume</H1>
    <h2>From 2019 → Present</h2>
<hr />
    <h3>First job (16 years old - part-time)</h3>
    <a href="https://dodopizza.ro/"><H6>Dodo Pizza</H6></a>
    <p>I've started my first job working as a Dough maker for <a href="https://dodopizza.ro/">Dodo Pizza</a> in 2019 when I was 16 years old.
    After a few months I was moved to another location from Lujerului, Bucharest to Pipera, Bucharest and was serving a part-time job still on
    the same thing (Dough making).
    </p>
    <p>Soon, I became the guy that made almost everything and was able to prepare pizza and sometimes deliver it.</p>
    <p>After sometime, the personal was running low so I accepted a job as a part-time delivery guy and they gave me an electric scooter wich was awesome not going to lie but, Soon
        I realized I was paid less then I should so I quit. Especially to focus on school because I had a big exam coming. In my country we're calling it BACALAUREAT.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h5> Time between jobs</h5>
    <p> So, as I was saying, I had a big exam coming and realized I had too less time to prepare for so in aproximately a week I've learnt almost everything for a passing score and I was able to succeed.
        What came after, took me by surprise but I realized I had two options: 
                <ol>
                    <li>go to collage</li>
                    <li>get a full time job</li>
                </ol>
        So, imagine what I chose, getting a full time job sounded more appealing, getting my hand on my own money, spending it the way I intend to.. sounded really nice at first.
    </p>
    <p> After the summer holiday I started looking for jobs and I found one. Being a Call Center agent for Altex Romania.</p>

<hr />
    <h3>Second Job (18 years old - full time)</h3>
    <a href="https://www.altex.ro"><H6>Altex Romania</H6></a>
    <p>I was 18 at that time and I've found a job for that age, being a Call Center Agent</p>
    <p>Let me tell you some things about Altex Romania - it's a Giant in my country and it basically a store that has more stores 
        But one thing is that being a call center agent for them meant answering more than 100 call per day, and let me tell you, that was
        not fun at all. But I kept answering and the main thing that made me get through this was the fous I was having on developing talking
        skills. After 4 months I was promoted to Altex Service Center - being a Call center service agent which meant I was looking up for the 
        aftersale experience of the customer.
    </p>
    <H4>Altex Service Center - Service Agent - still on call center</H4>
    <p>
        I was 19 now, and one focus, to better serve the customers and be able to make a name of my own in the company, to make me visible.
        And I sure suceeded. I was having the hardest talks with the most annoying clients and was making them understand every procedure and people,
        especially the teamleaders, managers and directores, noticed something in me. But soon, came a time when I was saying that I want to move.
        Soon enough, I've got a deal, moving to the MDA (Major Domestic Appliceses division to process service cases and find spare parts for products).
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4> Altex Service Center - MDA Technician - finally moved from the call center</h4>
    <p>
        Right now, when I'm writing this I am still working on the MDA department, it's not the best but it's way better than the call center experience where
        you would've get almost beaten by the customer for not being everything like him.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here, everyone is calm, sometimes it is really challanging to understand everyone needs but I know I make mine very clear. My boss is really
        cool sometimes, but when she's on her nerves, the hell erupts but I cannot get upset because I know that her boss is yelling at her too. Now, that's not the point
        The point is that here, I work a full time job where I manage parteners to get to the customers' home and check their products and check the parts that need to be replaced.
        I check the exploded schemes of the product, I find spare parts, positions and everything just to make the product work as it should in fewer that 15 days.
    </p>
    <p>Down below you'll find photos of the logos of the companies that I have and am working for.
        Thank you !
